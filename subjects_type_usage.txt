# Core Subjects | Subjects that are seen as integral parts of the overlord's state

* banking_family_subject = highly influential banking institutions and/or prominent wealthy merchants / moneylender. They are direct subjects of the crown and are obviously an integral part of the state. 
* administrative_region = specially designated regions such as special economic zones, national parks, etc. A direct part of the overlord's core lands. 
* exarchate_subject = highly centralized provinces with a governor who has significant devolved power. Fully controlled by the central state and integral part of the realm. Only primary difference vs direct provinces of the Empire is that exarchates have a large set of unilaterally devolved / delegated power (that the overlord may revoke at any time)
* real_union_subject = personal unions that have gone through such extensive centralization that they have become core provinces in all but name. They tend to have identical de jure laws as the overlord and is often ruled directly from the overlord, simply as a subdivision of the ruler's realm, rather than a fully separate and sovereign state. Most likely have lost most of its de jure sovereignty as well. Typically managed by an appointed governor, so in practice is effectively the same as an exarchate, albeit still vaguely larping as being its own sovereign state.

# Centralized Subjects | Subjects that have a high degree of central control and are seen as integral parts of the realm | Overlord Appointed leaders, frequently rotated. Overlord may annex at any time for any reason.

* se_integrated_personal_union = Definition 1: A highly integrated personal union that has come to share most laws with the overlord. Still holds significant de jure independence and sovereignty but is in practice effectively a highly centralized de jure vassal of the overlord. 
* native_reserve = A piece of land dedicated for a native tribe. They are granted a large degree of sovereignty that's directly superseded by the sovereignty of the overlord. Though the overlord treats the reserve fully as a de jure sovereign state, though fully dependent and indivisible from the overlord's territorial integrity. Given vast autonomy to administer their own lands, and typically does not follow the overlord in their foreign policy at all. In fact they typically are barred from conducting any foreign diplomacy at all. 
* agricultural_march = highly fertile land granted to local Duke-Administrators for the primary purpose of supplying food for the overlord.
* Dominions and Colonies = Self explanatory
* trade_outpost = An outpost hosted directly by the overlord to collect trade in a region. Led by centrally appointed merchants and burgher officials

# Regional Subjects | Subjects set in borderlands, that due to practicality are granted more autonomy than other centralized subjects. | Overlord Appointed Ruling Clans, periodically reconfirmed. Overlord may replace Ruling Clan. Overlord may annex at any time for any reason but limited by practicality.

* march = A heavily integrated subject that evolved from the earlier feudal marches. These are military commandants, that are run by a military bureaucracy that takes direct orders from the central government. Though due to these being typically on remote borderlands, constant back and forth communication is costly, so a certain degree of independence is granted to the military dukes of these marches, but with heavy central scrutiny and accountability. Seen as a vital core part of the realm, but due to their often extremely peripheral and remote locations, are typically not counted into the core direct holdings of the state. 
* defensive_march = Same as march, but for defensive regions
* naval_march = Similar to March but focused on naval military. Run by a centralized appointed Duke-Admiral rather than a Duke-General.

# Semi-centralized / Feudal Subjects | Subjects that have varying degrees of autonomy, but are typically seen as de jure parts of the realm | Overlord appointed Hereditary Ruling Clans. Overlord reserve right to annex under certain conditions

* se_integrated_personal_union = Definition 2: A slightly more centralized form of personal_union that allows some more economic control over the junior partner
* palatinate_vassal = A special feudal subject type for HRE electors
* personal_union = A feudal arrangement where the monarch of the senior partner also happens to rule the junior partner. Typically the entirety of the monarch's holdings are considered part of a realm (or crown or throne).
* fief_subject = A relatively small (county to duchy) sized feidal subject, that's similar to a personal_union but typically reserved for small states. Also typically most common in HRE
* brother_kingdom = A large kingdom ruled over by dynastic subjects. They have large leeway to run their country as they please, but are typically heavily bound by the overlord's realm-wide and dynastic-wide laws and policies. These are de jure parts of the dynastic realm.

# De Jure Subject States of the Realm
##########################################################################################################

# Decentralize Subjects | Subjects that have a moderate degree of autonomy and are seen as peripheral holdings / territories / associated subject states of the realm | Local Ruling Clans. Overlord confirms new Roman Client Kingdoms rulers. No right of annexation

* puppet_state = Generally a relatively large or remote state that we have strong dominance over. Due to their large size and/or remoteness, they have moderate autonomy to conduct their own domestic business. Generally considered as peripheral holdings that are not technically a part of the realm. 
* roman_client_kingdom = non-core large kingdoms with moderate central control. About on par with a puppet state. 
* chinese_tributary or jimi_state or any "supertributary" = A more centralized form of tributary that allows the Emperor to enforce certain rules and regulations while also potentially providing the Emperor some authority to mediate or arbitrate inter-tributary disputes with up to and including military intervention. However. like true tributaries, these states are fully sovereign and near completely independent. They are still seen as associated states of the realm due to the overlords ability to enforce certain diplomatic and domestic policies upon them.
* pirate_brotherhood_vassal = A pirate brotherhood that the overlord has either conquered or funded to be able to have some plausible deniability in raiding their rivals. The institutionalized form of privateering. Full and absolute political control is demanded by the overlord, but due to the practicalities of keeping things secretive, in reality, pirate brotherhood have heavy leeway to run their state as they choose.

# Associated States | Subjects that have a high degree of autonomy and although under the authority of the overlord are largely a loose association | Local Ruling Clans. No right of annexation

* protecorate = A large state that the overlord has pledged protection to in exchange for the ability to control their external diplomacy. In game will be treating these more as long term protection treaties combined with certain authority to influence their internal affairs. Rather than the "vassal in everything but name" form of protectorate that was common in history. Thus these are merely associated states of the realm. Although quite similar to a tributary, protectorates typically involve a bit more direct interference with local politics.
* tributary = A tributary state without any of the authoritative relationship of chinese tributary systems. This is simply an arrangement where one party continually pays tribute to another party in exchange for military protection. The tributary state is fully independent and sovereign and are at best associated with the overlord. 



# Others 

* vassal = A generic vassal that can fit pretty much anywhere in the centralization hierarchy. Typically a transitional state only
